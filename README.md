# FizzBuzz Kata in PHP
This repository contains an implementation of the classic [FizzBuzz kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) realized using Test-Driven Development (TDD) in PHP.

## 🌟 Features
- 🧪 Unit tests covering the core logic.
- 🔗 An integration test ensuring the cohesive functioning of components.
- 🏛️ Implementation following the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters pattern) for a maintainable and scalable codebase.

## 🔧 Usage
To launch the FizzBuzz program in the terminal:

```bash
./fizzbuzz
```
To run the PHPUnit tests:

```bash
./fizzbuzz test
```

## 🏗️ Architecture
The final implementation adheres to the principles of **Hexagonal Architecture**, promoting the separation of concerns, making the core logic independent of external factors, and ensuring better maintainability.
